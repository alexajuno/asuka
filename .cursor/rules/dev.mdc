# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
- Using `pnpm` for commands
- We are using shadcn/ui components and the ecosystem around it like TailwindCSS, lucide-react, etc.
- Remember to use `shadcn/ui` provided components rather than vanilla code.
- Check for duplicated components and wrap them if possible and suitable.
